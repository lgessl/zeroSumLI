Title: Elastic-Net Regularized Regression with ZeroSum Constraint
Description: Regressions functions for creating linear models with the
    elastic-net regularization and the zero-sum constraint (sum of
    coefficients = 0). The usage of this package is very similiar to
    that of the "glmnet" package.
